## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu) in the [Intelligent Robot Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu) advised by [George Konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). Previously, I got a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from Universidad Simon Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela and a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it) where I was fortunate to work with [Marcello Restelli](https://restelli.faculty.polimi.it/MyWebSite/index.shtml) and [Nicola Gatti](https://www.gametheory.polimi.it/nicola-gatti.html).

## Research Interests

I am generally interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically, in Embodied Intelligence. Currently, I am interested in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its intersection with other AI areas, such as Natural Language Understanding, in order to design embodied agents that are able to exploit effectively prior knowledge and supervision from different sources.
